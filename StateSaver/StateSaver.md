State Saver is a simple tool to save the current state of your Components variables and restore them later.
It is useful for storing if you have made your changes during play, or if you want to hold on to some good settings before getting in there and changing them all

Currently it only works for custom components
To access it, click the Three dots next to the component name in the inspector and select State Saver

It will create a JSON file tin your root assets folder to store your states
